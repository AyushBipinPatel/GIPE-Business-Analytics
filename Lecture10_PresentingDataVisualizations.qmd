## Why is good visualization so important? {.scrollable}

+ Every visualization has a story to tell, which requires skill
+ It is important that the reader presents data effectively, to prompt correct action or discussion 
+ Data visualization is not a tool, it is a means for communicating results
+ To understand good visualization, let us take a look at 

## Say no to 3D graphs! {.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   3D graphs makes the visualizations redundant and complex for no reason
-   The bars at the front hide the ones at the back.
-   Other than looking flashy, they almost never serve the purpose of conveying information
-   The tilt makes it even more difficult to read the values

## The more, the merrier? {.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   This graphic tries to show MLA salaries
-   The information overload makes it look aesthetically unpleasant
-   With all the information, it looks difficult to understand
-   Provided with such a visual, the audience would not be able to understand anything of substance

## Misleading Visualization {.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Massive growth in iPhone sales, isn’t it?
-   However, a closer look shows that the sales are cumulative over time
-   Cumulative sales don’t necessarily show growth
-   Moreover, the graph does not have a scale on the y-axis
-   It isn’t clear what the graph is trying to show

## Avoid Pie Charts {.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Pie chart, in most cases, are not the best approach to visualize data.
-   Not only do they add up to 100% in this case, they also make it difficult to comprehend which component has the biggest share
-   When you choose a donut chart, you are essentially asking your audience to measure the arc length to see which has the biggest share
-   Redundant, no? A simple bar chart would have done the job

## Always a zero baseline {.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   There seems to be a major difference between democrats and republicans for percent of people who agreed with court
-   However, at a closer look, the visualization has been made with a baseline of 50% which means that the difference is only around 8%
-   Graphs must always be made with a zero baseline to not exaggerate the scale

#### Understand the context

+ It should ask for an action and convey a point
+ For this, you need to know exactly what piece of information you want to convey
+ Your visualizations becomes a means for this communication
