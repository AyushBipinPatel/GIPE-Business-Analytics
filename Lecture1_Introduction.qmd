## RStudio projects - Why?

#### [Content for this topic has been sourced from [Danielle Navarro's workshop](https://djnavarro.net/chdss2018/day2/projects.html). Please check out her [work](https://djnavarro.net/chdss2018/) for detailed information.]{style="font-size:15px"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1" style="font-size:30px"}
The core idea behind RStudio Projects, in their own words, is that

> RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

-   **Why should I use RStudio projects?**
    -   **Convenience**
        -   Keeps things tidy
        -   Smooths the process
    -   **Functionality**
        -   RStudio projects have a `.Rproj` file, this serves as an anchor for other packages
        -   Also useful for sharing code with other people

## RStudio projects - How? {.scrollable}

#### [Content for this topic has been sourced from [Danielle Navarro's workshop](https://djnavarro.net/chdss2018/day2/projects.html). Please check out her [work](https://djnavarro.net/chdss2018/) for detailed information.]{style="font-size:15px"}

::: panel-tabset
### 1. Select new Project

[Go to the the little blue menu in the top the top right corner in RStudio, click on the dropdown menu, and select "New Project".]{style="font-size:25px"}

```{=html}
<iframe src="https://djnavarro.net/chdss2018/day2/images/new_rstudio_project1.jpg" scrolling= "yes" width = 1600 height = 300></iframe>
```
### 2. Select Directory

[This will bring up a dialog box that provides a few different options. If you are going to work in a new folder, choose 'New Directory'. If you want to work in an existing folder, select 'Existing Directory' and browse for the location.]{style="font-size:25px"}

```{=html}
<iframe src="https://djnavarro.net/chdss2018/day2/images/new_rstudio_project2.jpg" scrolling= "yes" width = 1600 height = 300></iframe>

## RStudio Projects - How?

### 3. There, you have your project

[Once you've created the project, if you have a look at the folder in Windows Explorer / Mac Finder, you'll see your file!]{style="font-size:25px"}

## Data Wrangling - What and Why

#### What is data wrangling?

::: {style="font-size:30px"}
::: incremental
-   It is not often that you get the data you want to work with in a specific format. You will always want to add, delete, filter or transform variables.
-   Also, when you start exploring your data, you would want to create summaries of variables.
-   This transformation or manipulation of data is called data wrangling.

#### Why should I learn it?

-   Because you will almost never get data that is already in the format that you want to work in.
-   Through this course, you will learn data wrangling techniques in R using the `dplyr` and `tidyverse` packages.

## Data Visualization

#### What is data visualization?

::: {style="font-size:30px"}
::: incremental
-   Graphical representation of data
-   Converting large amounts of data into easily comprehensible visuals

#### Why should I learn it?

-   To present data in an appealing manner
-   To understand patterns from data
-   Through this course, you will learn data visualization techniques in R using the `ggplot2` package.

## Literate Programming

#### [Content for this topic has been sourced from [Stephanie Hicks's lecture](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatcomputing2022/posts/2022-09-01-literate-programming/#introduction). Please check out her work for detailed information.]{style="font-size:15px"}

#### What is Literate Programming?

::: {style="font-size:30px"}
::: incremental
-   Make writing reproducible reports easier is known as literate statistical programming
-   Think of a report or a publication as a stream of text and code
    -   The text is readable by people and the code is readable by computers
    -   The analysis is described in code chunks
    -   Each text chunk will relay something in a human readable language

#### Why should I learn it?

-   Because the aim is not just to learn to write code, but to write it in a way that it is readable and reproducible
-   Through this course, you will learn literate programming skills in R with `R Markdown`

## Exercise

-   By next week, set up your own Github account and website
-   You can use the help of this [resource](https://stat545.com/version-control.html)
-   ALSOO, **fully completing this gives you 3 marks as extra credit** :)
