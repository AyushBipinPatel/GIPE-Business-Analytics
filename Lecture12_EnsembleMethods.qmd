## Ensemble Methods - Why?{.scrollable}
#### [Content for this topic has been sourced from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com). Please check out the work for detailed information.]{style="font-size:15px"}

+ In the previous lecture, you learnt about decision trees
+ Decision trees can be non-robust and not highly accurate
+ Hence, you can aggregate many decision trees
+ These methods are bagging, boosting and random forests

## Ensemble Methods - What?{.scrollable}
#### [Content for this topic has been sourced from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com). Please check out the work for detailed information.]{style="font-size:15px"}

+ An ensemble method combines many simple “building block” models in order to obtain a single and potentially very powerful model
+ In simple words, instead of using a single model, this approach improves the accuracyin results by combining many models
+ The "simple building block" models are also known as weak learners, since on their own, they may lead to mediocre predictions with less accuracy
